        <h3>Vue (pronounced /vjuÀê/, like view) is a progressive 
        framework for building user interfaces. Unlike other monolithic 
        frameworks, Vue is designed from the ground up to be incrementally adoptable. The core library is focused on the view layer only, and is easy to pick up and integrate with other libraries or existing projects. On the other hand, Vue is also perfectly capable of powering sophisticated Single-Page Applications when used in combination with modern tooling and supporting libraries.</h3>
        <h1>The pros</h1>
        <h2>The official guide assumes intermediate level knowledge of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. If you are totally new to frontend development, it might not be the best idea to jump right into a framework as your first step - grasp the basics then come back! Prior experience with other frameworks helps, but is not required.

        The easiest way to try out Vue.js is using the Hello World example. Feel free to open it in another tab and follow along as we go through some basic examples. Or, you can create an index.html file and include Vue with:
        
        <!-- development version, includes helpful console warnings -->
        <script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/vue/dist/vue.js"></script>
        
        or:
        
        <!-- production version, optimized for size and speed -->
        <script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/vue"></script>
        
        The Installation page provides more options of installing Vue. Note: We do not recommend that beginners start with vue-cli, especially if you are not yet familiar with Node.js-based build tools.
